Basic testing of command line inputs to learn about Git and Github via CS50
For the CS50 final project my goal was to: \
**1. Develop Locally** \
**2. Learn Git and Github** \
The following links were provided by CS50 which helped me learn how to achieve 1. and 2. stated above. 

**1. Develop locally on a local vscode instead of cs50 virtual machine codespaces via github** \
a) Downloading Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL) \

Takeaway 1: Setting up windows susbsytem for linux with ubuntu to get the terminal CS50 uses which is linux and utilise linux in vscode \
Takeaway 2: Learnign about apt-get being the genral packet manager, and for example pip3 is the packet manager within python \
Takeaway 3: Installing relevant extensions in vscode that you want  

**2. Learn Git and Github** \
